[00:00.41] 作曲 : TeddyLoid
[00:00.82] 编曲 : TeddyLoid
[00:01.24]I used to look above at stars, and chase
[00:05.32]Never had to doubt what I could take
[00:09.48]Now I've found it's further than it seemed
[00:13.29]The light gets smaller, my eyes to a closure
[00:17.52]
[00:18.41]When did it happen？ Turned away my face
[00:22.43]When did it happen？ Pain increasing
[00:26.59]Shadow walk and dealing, truth inside revealing
[00:30.72]Still, a part of me's seeking that feeling
[00:33.00]
[00:33.54]Dreams in the sound that I made for you
[00:37.76]Go 'round, come returning through me
[00:42.97]Where this light shines so bright, you showed
[00:49.82]It's back and now
[00:51.26]
[00:51.78]Take your hand out, we can reach
[00:53.17]Always been there to be freed
[00:55.35]It's getting loud, on to a scream
[00:57.31]We're starting this brighter tomorrow
[01:02.81]Try this
[01:05.90]Every color shown, bright in the star
[01:14.75]From here we can find
[01:19.47]Letting us shine
[01:23.61]Don't hide your brightness
[01:24.90]
[01:26.71]Approval of someone to feel complete
[01:30.87]Honesty was gone to say the least
[01:35.05]Many things about us are the same
[01:38.82]The distance for us is hard to decipher
[01:43.19]
[01:43.51]Why did it happen？ I've imagined your face
[01:48.04]Thinking about this lonely feeling
[01:52.19]Standing still exceeding, urge and drive increasing
[01:56.46]I've gotta be by you and speaking
[01:58.98]
[01:59.31]A little time has been taken
[02:03.35]I find it was time we needed
[02:08.43]When our minds are aligned, we know
[02:15.31]That star's in view
[02:16.86]
[02:17.20]Let's restart it, you and me
[02:18.75]Walking on our new story
[02:20.89]I feel your voice, my melodies
[02:22.83]Don't worry when struggling to follow
[02:28.32]Find this
[02:32.49]Allow this
[02:33.22]
[02:33.57]Take your hand out, we can reach
[02:35.33]Always been there to be freed
[02:37.51]It's getting loud, on to a scream
[02:39.47]We're starting this brighter tomorrow
[02:44.99]Try this
[02:48.17]Every color shown, bright in the star
[02:56.02]From here we can find
[03:02.04]Letting us shine
[03:05.77]Don't hide your brightness
